                        What is a Transfer Case?

                    </h2>
                    <p>

                        A transfer case is a critical component in four-wheel-drive (4WD) and all-wheel-drive (AWD) vehicles. It serves as the command center for power distribution between the front and rear axles. Mounted directly to the transmission, the transfer case receives power from the engine and allocates it to both sets of wheels, enabling a vehicle to navigate challenging landscapes with ease.
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        Designed for occasional off-road adventures, part-time transfer cases allow the driver to manually engage or disengage the four-wheel-drive mode. This flexibility helps conserve fuel during regular driving conditions and provides additional torque when the going gets tough.
