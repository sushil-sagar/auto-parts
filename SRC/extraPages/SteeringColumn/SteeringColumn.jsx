          <h2>The Steering Column </h2>
          <p>
            The command center of your vehicle's directional prowess â€“ the Steering Column. This often-underappreciated component is a critical part of your vehicle's steering system, connecting the steering wheel to the rest of the steering mechanism. Let's take a closer look at the steering column and understand its significance in ensuring a responsive and controlled driving experience.
          </p>
          <p>

            While the steering column may operate behind the scenes, its role in your vehicle's steering system is paramount. A well-maintained steering column ensures that your steering inputs are translated into precise and reliable directional control. Regular inspections and prompt maintenance contribute to a comfortable and safe driving experience, allowing you to navigate the roads with confidence.

            What is a Throttle Body?

          </h2>
          <p>



            What is a Steering Column?
            The steering column is a vertical shaft that connects the steering wheel to the steering mechanism of a vehicle. It serves as the conduit for the driver's input, translating steering wheel movements into directional adjustments for the vehicle.

          </p>
          <h4>
            Key Components of the Steering Column:
          </h4>
          <h6>
            1. Steering Shaft:
          </h6>
          <br />
          <p>

            The steering shaft is the main vertical component of the steering column that extends from the steering wheel to the steering gearbox or rack.

          </p>
          <h6>2. Universal Joints:</h6><br />
          <p>






            Universal joints connect the steering shaft to the steering gearbox or rack, allowing for flexibility and movement as the vehicle turns.

          </p>
          <h6>
            3. Tilt Mechanism:
          </h6><br />
          <p>


            In some vehicles, the steering column features a tilt mechanism, allowing the driver to adjust the angle and height of the steering wheel for comfort.

          </p>
          <h6>4. Ignition Switch:</h6><br /><p>


            The ignition switch, in many cases, is integrated into the steering column, allowing the driver to start and stop the vehicle conveniently.

            How the Steering Column Works:
          </h2>
          <h6>
            Driver Input:
          </h6>
          <br />
          <p>



            When the driver turns the steering wheel, the steering column transmits this input to the steering shaft.

          </p>
          <h6>
            Steering Shaft Movement:</h6><br />
          <p>


            The steering shaft, connected to the steering wheel and universal joints, undergoes rotational movement based on the driver's input.

          </p>
          <h6>

            Transmission to Steering Mechanism:</h6><br />
          <p>





            The rotational movement of the steering shaft is transmitted to the steering gearbox or rack, initiating the turning of the vehicle's wheels.

          </p>
          <h6> Universal Joint Flexibility:</h6>
          <br />
          <p>



            Universal joints on the steering column allow for flexibility and accommodate variations in the angle between the steering wheel and the steering mechanism.
