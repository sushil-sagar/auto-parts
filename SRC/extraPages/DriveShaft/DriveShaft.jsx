                        What is a Drive Shaft?

                    </h2>
                    <p>



                        A Drive Shaft, also known as a propeller shaft, is a rotating shaft that transfers torque from the vehicle's transmission to the differential, and ultimately to the wheels. It serves as a vital link in the chain of power transmission, allowing for the conversion of rotational power into linear motion.

                    </p>
                    <h4>
                    Key Components of a Drive Shaft:
                    </h4>
                    <h6>
                    1. Shaft Tube:
                    </h6>
                    <br />
                    <p>




                      
                     
                        The main body of the Drive Shaft, typically a cylindrical or tubular structure, providing structural support and housing internal components.

                    </p>
                    <h6>
                    2. Universal Joints (U-Joints):</h6><br />
                    <p>




                    
                        Located at each end of the Drive Shaft, U-Joints allow for flexibility and movement, accommodating changes in angle between the transmission and the differential.

                    </p>
                    <h6>     . Slip Yoke:</h6><br />
                    <p>




                        3
                        The Slip Yoke is a splined component that allows for the expansion and contraction of the Drive Shaft's length, compensating for changes in suspension height.

                    </p>
                    <h6>       4. Center Support Bearing:</h6><br /><p>


                 
                        In longer Drive Shafts, a center support bearing provides additional support and stability, reducing vibrations and ensuring a smooth transfer of power.

                        Flexibility and Articulation:</h6><br />
                    <p>




                        Universal Joints at each end of the Drive Shaft allow for flexibility, accommodating variations in angle and ensuring a smooth transfer of power, even in situations where the transmission and differential are not perfectly aligned.
