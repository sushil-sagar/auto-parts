            Understanding the Axle Shaft:
          </h2>
          <p>

            The Axle Shaft is a rod-like component that connects the differential to the wheels, transmitting rotational power from the engine to the wheels to facilitate movement. In simple terms, it's the bridge that carries the torque generated by the engine to the wheels, ensuring a smooth and controlled ride.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Key Components of an Axle Shaft:
          </h4>
          <h6>  1. Splines:</h6><br />
          <p>

            The splines on the inner end of the Axle Shaft engage with the differential, allowing for the transfer of rotational force.

          </p>
          <h6>  2. CV Joints (Constant Velocity):</h6><br />
          <p>


            Many modern vehicles feature Constant Velocity joints on the outer ends of the Axle Shaft. These joints accommodate varying angles and speeds during wheel movement, ensuring a consistent velocity for smooth operation.

          </p>
          <h6>   3. Flange or Hub:</h6><br />
          <p>


            The outer end of the Axle Shaft connects to the wheel hub or flange, securing the shaft in place and facilitating the rotation of the wheel.

          </p>

          <h2>How the Axle Shaft Works:</h2>
          <h6>   Power Transfer:</h6><br />
          <p>



            The Axle Shaft receives rotational power from the differential, converting it into linear motion that drives the wheels.

          </p>
          <h6>
            Flexibility in Movement:</h6><br />
          <p>




            The presence of CV joints allows the Axle Shaft to flex and adapt to different angles and speeds, ensuring a constant velocity during turns and varying road conditions.

          </p>
          <h6>Wheel Rotation:</h6><br />
          <p>

            The outer end of the Axle Shaft connects to the wheel hub, enabling the rotation of the wheel in sync with the transmitted power.
